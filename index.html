    <h1> My Inspiring Figure is: Wiflredo Leon. </h1>
        <img src="GetImage.jpg">
        <p> Wilfredo Leon is my inspring character for a few reasons. 1. He inspires me because he went on Cuba's national team when he was only 14 years old. That is crazy! 2. He is super good. His jump is incredible, his hits are always 95km/h+ and incredible smartness. I think I have great potential to become like him one day! </p>
